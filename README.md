### My Angular specialization project outlet!

##STEPS I NEED TO FOLLOW TO ENSURE SMOOTH FLOW OF UPDATE:

#### 1. Navigate to project directory:
    In Personal PC- cd project-app1
    In Other PC- cd Angular

After making all the changes

#### 2. Pushing the changes 
    ```bash
    git add .
    ```
    ```bash
    git commit -m "Your commit message"
    ```
    ```bash
    git push origin main
    ```
All done!

#### 3. In order to recieve the newly added changes:
    ```bash
    git pull origin main
    ```

### All Done! Work Hard, Have Fun and Make History!!
