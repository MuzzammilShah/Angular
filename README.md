# Angular Specialization Project Outlet

---
NOTE: I've been updating this GitHub project as an outlet for the Course on Angular I've been doing. I'll be adding newer projects or updating the existing ones as I continue with my Angular learning anytime during my upskilling journey.

I've added two parts to this README notes:
1. Steps to update the repo (As a personal note to myself)
2. The actual installation steps to execute the project

Happy coding!

## Steps for a Smooth Update Flow

### 1. Navigate to Project Directory
- **Personal PC:** 
    ```sh
    cd project-app1
    ```
- **Other PC:** 
    ```sh
    cd Angular
    ```

### 2. Push Changes
- **Select all files in the directory:**
    ```sh
    git add .
    ```
- **Set a commit message:**
    ```sh
    git commit -m "Your commit message"
    ```
- **Push the code:**
    ```sh
    git push origin main
    ```

### 3. Pull Newly Added Changes
    ```sh
    git pull origin main
    ```

All done! Work hard, have fun, and make history!
